<!--    Click Counter Lab - Create the layout of an app that counts the number
                            of times a button is pressed.
            Should include:
            1. a TextView with ID "click_counter_text" - this will keep track of the number of times
                the “click_button” was pressed.
            2. a Button with ID "click_button" - pressing this button will increase the number of
                clicks shown by “click_counter_text” by 1.
            3. a Button with ID "reset_button" - pressing this button will reset the number of
                clicks on the “click_button” to 0, which will be reflected by “click_counter_text”.

       Try and race your friends to see who can achieve the most clicks in a minute! -->
